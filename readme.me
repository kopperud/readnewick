## algorithm for computing all splits:

Initial step: compute the set of all tip labels `A`.

Sub-algorithm:
1. Begin at an internal node N. Store all descendants in a set `D`
2. Perform a postorder traversal of the subtree descending from `N`. Record the visited tip labels and store them in `D`.
3. Compute the complementary tip labels as L as the difference between `A` and `D`
4. Store the split (L, D)
 
 Repeat the above sub-algorithm for all internal (not root) nodes N.
 The left and right subtrees descending from the root will have complementary splits. 
 For example, (E|ABCD) for the left subtree, and (ABCD|E) for the right subtree.
